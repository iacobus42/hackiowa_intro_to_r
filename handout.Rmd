```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Setup

You will need to have a version of R installed. It can be downloaded for your
system at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Also you will want to install
the `tidyverse` inside R. You can do this by running 
`install.packages("tidyverse")` in an R session. Finally, while not required, 
the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/) will make your R sessions much 
easier to manage.
